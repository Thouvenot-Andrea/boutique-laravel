**As a** a member of [the development team](http://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-dev),
**I want** clear context and goals **so that** I can work efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria

[] I have clear Acceptance criteria [what a beautiful recursion].
[] I have to understand the logic of the mockups, more than the pixels used, so that we can optimize the code.

Please also note:

1. If a conversation about the issue I’m working on is happening,
the outcomes should be documented within that issue (not in the comments).
